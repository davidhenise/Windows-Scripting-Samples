'How This Function Works:
'
'The case names and string names can be modified for use in a new script. 
'However, in the text below, the argument types are identified by the switches /ss /sn /sc AND /res
'These argument types are equated to the "cases" in the Select function.
'Then, the arguments themselves follow these switches the same as they might when passed to a DOS or 
'Shell program on the command line and are then equated to the strings in each case in the function.
